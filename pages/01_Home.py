## Welcome to the Billboard Hot 100 Analysis and Machine Learning Project. 
## This is a personal project by me, Cesario Angel Ibarra, 
### a musician and composer with 30 years of experience and four published albums on all streaming platforms. 
### I have always been fascinated by the mathematical nature of music, how frequency, time and vibration 
### make up the fabric of the universe and how music is a manifestation of this phenomenon. 
### In this project, I will use data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore the similarities and differences
### among the songs that make it to the Hot 100, the most popular songs in the US. 
### I will examine how these songs share the same musical structure, such as key signature, duration, valence, etc. 
### My goal is to demonstrate how music can be understood and created using scientific methods, 
### as well as to appreciate the diversity and creativity of musical expression.
